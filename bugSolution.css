To solve this, ensure the parent container has a defined width.  Here's a corrected version:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}

.parent {
  width: 800px; /* Or any defined width */
}
```

By setting the `width` of the parent element (`.parent`), we provide a clear reference for the percentage calculation within `calc()`.  Alternatively, consider using viewport units (`vw`) or other absolute units if the width's relation to the parent is unimportant.
